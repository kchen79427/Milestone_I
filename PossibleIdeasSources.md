## Possbile Ideas
1. Explore the relationships between solar capacities, energy use, and CO2 emissions by countries. We could maybe link up with GDP or health rate.

* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasertk/solar-power-by-country (source is from wikipedia, we could potentially scrap this ourselves.)
downside: smaller sets of data but we could still do analysis and might be simpler.


2. Explore police-public contact through survey data conducted in 2018. We can explore the opinions of the contact, maybe even look at the porportions of the satisfaction of the contact to sex, race/ethnicity, age, or income.
* https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/37916 (this is a fairly large dataset<, I want to say 80k records). There isn't location information so I am not sure how we can link this dataset to something else but would be neat if we could.

3. Explore the top 1000 rated movies on IMDB, maybe we could look at the years with the highest rated films, their genres and look back at the world economy or big events and see if there are any correlations?
